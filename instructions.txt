Instuctions : Make a directory for every exercise you complete and insert your resources 
	      into those directories accordingly. once you have completed an exercise or
	      project then I would recommend pushing it to your branch via Github.

Rules	    : You are allowed to work together. Don't know something? > Ask a friend, G-
	      oogle, man etc. Only use Terminal commands to complete these exercises.
